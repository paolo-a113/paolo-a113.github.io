                funding for lab equipment. Smart Cookies can provide students in low-resource areas the ability to explore the world through tablet distribution programs

                ESP82666 module, while still allowing room for the program. Prototypes of the embedded web app use Google's Material Design Lite framework to achieve a minimal, clean, and functional user interface. Chart.js is used for the data visualization
                elements and smooth animations that add vitality to the realtime data stream.

                While a single Smart Cookie can be used as a self-contained data collection tool, using multiple Smart Cookies in close proximity with each other automatically creates a decentralized mesh network that intelligently routes data packets through other Smart
                Cookies, through a root node, then to a low-cost tablet can be connected to visualize realtime telemetry from all Smart Cookies. This allows the effective range of data collection extend far beyond the estimated 100m signal radius of a
                single WiFi module.
