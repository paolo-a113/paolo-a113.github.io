	<div class="bio_desc"><p>Hi, my name is Paolo Arguelles. I’m a 20-year-old engineer from Los Angeles. I hold a master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University.

		<br>
		<br>After attending Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic School in Santa Clarita from kindergarten to 8th grade, I began my college journey at California State University - Los Angeles, matriculating at the age of 14. Soon after, I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, graduating <i>summa cum laude.</i> I was named an Edison Scholar by the Honors College in 2014 and was honored by the Barry Goldwater Scholarship committee in 2016 for my research proposal on black holes. I served as president of the Early Entrance Program Club, campus chair of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and was a student staff member at the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs. I’m a proud member of the honor societies of Phi Kappa Phi and Tau Beta Pi.‍
		<br>
		<br>
		At Cornell University, I conducted my graduate thesis work on a surface acoustic wave MEMS gyroscope (intended for high velocity ballistics) with Prof. Amit Lal. I was also a member of the Collective Embodied Intelligence Laboratory under Prof. Kirstin Petersen where I conducted research in bio-inspired swarm robotics. I was also a researcher at Cornell's Space Systems Design Studio (SSDS) under Prof. Mason Peck, where I developed the software and electrical subsystems for the Spacecraft Flight Simulator and Attitude Testbed.
		<br>
		<br>After graduating this past spring, I am enjoying a gap year before embarking on new and exciting adventures.
		<br>‍
