		<p>My name is Paolo Arguelles. I’m a 20-year-old engineer from Los Angeles. I recently graduated with my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University.
		<br>
		<br>After attending Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic School in Santa Clarita from kindergarten to 8th grade, I began my academic career at California State University - Los Angeles, starting college at the age of 14. Soon after, I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, graduating <i>summa cum laude</i> with a near-perfect 3.99 GPA. I was named an Edison Scholar by the Honors College in 2014 and was honored by the Barry Goldwater Scholarship committee in 2016 for my research proposal on black holes. I served as president of the Early Entrance Program Club, campus chair of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and was a student staff member at the <a class="description" href="https://calstatela.patbrowninstitute.org/">Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs.</a> I’m a proud member of the honor societies of Phi Kappa Phi and Tau Beta Pi.‍
		<br>
		<br>
		At Cal State LA, I conducted chemistry research with Prof. Frank Gomez in his <a class="description" href="http://www.calstatela.edu/research/gomez">Microfluidics and Point-of-Care Diagnostics Lab</a> where I worked on low-cost, paper-based analytical devices and assays. I was also part of a biomedical engineering effort led by Professor Deborah Won to study how the "gamification" of realtime biosignals can help motivate spinal cord injury patients that lead largely sedentary lifestyles to exercise. For my capstone senior design project, I worked with Northrop Grumman engineers and Professor Ni Li to study solar sails as a novel form of CubeSat and small satellite attitude control. I have published academic papers in all three aforementioned areas.
		<br>
		<br>
		At Cornell University, I conducted my <a class="description" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14Oq3hS3MMPKUw-liC0vY6UmY0RChMz0z/view?usp=sharing">graduate thesis</a> work on an acoustic MEMS gyroscope intended for use in missile guidance systems with Professor Amit Lal. I was also a member of the <a class="description" href="https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/">Collective Embodied Intelligence Laboratory</a> led by <a class="description" href="https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/kirstin-hagelskjaer-petersen">Prof. Kirstin Petersen</a> where I conducted research in bio-inspired swarm robotics. I co-authored a paper on our research work which will be published in <i>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</i> in early 2020. I was also a researcher at Cornell's <a class="description" href="https://www.spacecraftresearch.com/">Space Systems Design Studio (SSDS)</a> under <a class="description" href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/mason-peck">Prof. Mason Peck,</a> the former NASA Chief Technologist, where I developed the software and electrical subsystems for the <a class="description" href="./projects-ssds.htm">Spacecraft Flight Simulator and Attitude Testbed.</a>
		
		<br>
		<br>After graduating this past spring, I am enjoying a gap year before embarking on new and exciting adventures.
