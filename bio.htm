        <p>Hey there, and thanks for stopping by my website! I'm a systems engineer at Sandia National Laboratories in the Bay Area working in nuclear deterrence R&D. I earned my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Cornell University at the age of 20.
            <br>
            <br>I began college when I was 14 years old, starting my academic career at California State University -
            Los Angeles. Soon after, I received my bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering, graduating <i>summa cum
                laude</i> with a near-perfect 3.99 GPA. I was named an <a class="description"
                href="http://www.calstatela.edu/univ/ppa/publicat/academic-excellence-passion-earn-students-edison-scholarships">Edison
                Scholar</a> by the Honors College in 2014 and was <a class="description"
                href="https://goldwater.scholarsapply.org/2016-honorable-mentions/">honored</a> by the Barry Goldwater
            Scholarship Foundation in 2016. I served as president of the
            Early Entrance Program Club, campus chair of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),
            and volunteered as a student staff member at the <a class="description"
                href="https://calstatela.patbrowninstitute.org/">Pat
                Brown Institute for Public
                Affairs.</a> I am a proud member of the honor societies of Phi Kappa Phi and Tau Beta Pi.‍
            <br>
            <br> At Cal State LA, I conducted chemistry research with Prof. Frank Gomez in his <a class="description"
                href="http://www.calstatela.edu/research/gomez">Microfluidics and Point-of-Care Diagnostics Lab</a>
            where I worked on low-cost, paper-based
            analytical devices and assays. I was also part of a biomedical engineering effort led by <a
                class="description" href="http://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/deborah-won">Prof.
                Deborah Won</a> to study how the "gamification" of realtime biosignals can help motivate spinal cord
            injury patients that lead largely sedentary lifestyles to exercise. For my senior capstone project, I worked
            with Northrop Grumman engineers
            and Prof. Ni Li to study articulating solar sails as a novel form of CubeSat attitude control. I have
            published academic papers in all three aforementioned areas. Upon graduation, I was selected by engineering
            faculty to deliver a <a class="description" href="./speech.htm">speech</a> at the university's annual honors
            convocation and was the class speaker for the Honors College.
            <br>
            <br> I began graduate study at Cornell University becoming one of the youngest graduate
            students at the college. I conducted my <a class="description"

                thesis</a> work with <a class="description"
                href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/amit-lal">Prof. Amit Lal</a> and DARPA on a
            surface acoustic wave MEMS gyroscope for missile guidance systems. I was a researcher at
            the <a class="description" href="https://cei.ece.cornell.edu/">Collective Embodied Intelligence
                Laboratory</a> where I conducted research in bio-inspired swarm robotics with <a class="description"

                Petersen</a>. I was also a researcher at Cornell's
            <a class="description" href="https://www.spacecraftresearch.com/">Space
                Systems Design Studio (SSDS)</a> under <a class="description"
                href="https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/mason-peck">Prof. Mason Peck,</a> the former
            NASA Chief Technologist, where I developed the software

                Simulator and
                Attitude
                Testbed.</a>

            <br>
            <br>In addition to taking a gap year during the pandemic, I started a nonprofit to help close the digital
            divide.
